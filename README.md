# LangChain

LangChain is a powerful framework designed to build applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides essential components to work with LLMs efficiently, including prompt engineering, memory management, document processing, and agents. This README will guide you through the core modules of LangChain and provide useful links for further learning.

## Core Components

### 1. LangChain LLM
LangChain provides seamless integration with various LLMs, such as Gemini, Hugging Face. It allows users to call LLM APIs, fine-tune models, and optimize interactions.

### 2. Document Processing
 handles Document Loaders, and chunking of large documents to make them suitable for processing by LLMs.

### 3. Embeddings and Retrieval
LangChain enables vector-based search and retrieval by converting text into embeddings. It supports multiple embedding models and vector databases(FAISS) 

### 4. Prompt Engineering
Crafting effective prompts is crucial for optimal model performance. LangChain provides utilities to structure and optimize prompts dynamically.

### 5. Output Parsers
Output parsers help in structuring the responses from LLMs into a predefined format, making them easier to process programmatically.

### 6. Memory
Memory allows models to retain context across interactions. LangChain provides various memory types, including short-term and long-term memory.

### 7. Chains
Chains are sequences of calls that link multiple components, such as LLM calls, prompt templates, and output processing, to build complex workflows.

### 8. Tools
LangChain offers tools that enable LLMs to interact with external systems 

### 9. Agents
Agents use LLMs to make decisions dynamically and select tools to complete a task. They bring reasoning and flexibility to AI applications.

### 10. LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)
LCEL is a new way to construct chains using a more intuitive and composable syntax.
